<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single Phase String Inverters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Grid System Type</li><li>Off-Grid System Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The single-phase string inverters market is divided into two types: on-grid system and off-grid system. On-grid system type refers to inverters that are connected to the utility grid, allowing excess energy produced by solar panels to be fed back into the grid. These inverters are commonly used in residential or commercial properties where electricity is primarily sourced from the grid. In contrast, off-grid system type inverters are not connected to the utility grid, making them suitable for remote areas or locations that lack access to the grid, as they can store and utilize the solar energy generated independently.</p></p>

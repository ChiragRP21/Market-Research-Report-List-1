<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyethersulfone Dialyzer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Permeability</li><li>Low Permeability</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Polyethersulfone dialyzers are used in kidney dialysis to remove waste products from the blood. High permeability dialyzers have a larger pore size, allowing for efficient removal of waste and better clearance of toxins. They are suitable for patients with high waste levels in their blood. On the other hand, low permeability dialyzers have smaller pores that result in decreased clearance of smaller molecules. These dialyzers are used for patients with lower waste levels or in situations where removing larger molecules is not necessary. Overall, dialyzers are selected based on the patient's specific needs and waste levels.</p></p>

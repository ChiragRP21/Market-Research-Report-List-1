<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Truck Starter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Control</li><li>Electromagnetic Control</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Truck starters can be categorized into two main market types: direct control and electromagnetic control. Direct control starters are manually operated by engaging a lever or a switch to directly connect the starter motor to the truck's electrical system. On the other hand, electromagnetic control starters use an electromagnetic switch called a solenoid, which is activated by a smaller control current, allowing for remote operation of the starter motor. These market types refer to the different mechanisms used to control and activate the truck starter.</p></p>

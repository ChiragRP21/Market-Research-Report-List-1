<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stationary Gas Chromatography Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gas-solid chromatography (GSC)</li><li>Gas-liquid chromatography (GLC)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Stationary Gas Chromatography Devices are classified into two main types: Gas-solid chromatography (GSC) and Gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). In GSC, the stationary phase is a solid material, which interacts with the mobile gas phase through adsorption or absorption. This type of chromatography is useful for separating gaseous compounds based on their affinity to the solid stationary phase. On the other hand, GLC involves a liquid stationary phase coated on a solid support, enabling separation of volatile compounds based on their partitioning between the liquid and gas phases. Both techniques are widely used in various analytical applications.</p></p>

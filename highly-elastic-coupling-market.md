<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Highly-Elastic Coupling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spiral Groove Type</li><li>Parallel Groove Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The highly-elastic coupling market consists of two main types: spiral groove type and parallel groove type. In the spiral groove type, the coupling uses a spiral groove pattern on the surface to achieve high elasticity and flexibility, providing excellent shock absorption and misalignment compensation. On the other hand, the parallel groove type coupling features parallel grooves that allow for axial, radial, and angular misalignment, making it suitable for applications with high torque and misalignment requirements. Both types are widely used in various industries for their ability to enhance coupling performance and durability.</p></p>

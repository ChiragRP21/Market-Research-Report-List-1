<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Railway AC Units Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centralized</li><li>Local Centralized</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Railway AC Units market can be classified into two types - Centralized and Local Centralized. </p><p>Centralized AC units are designed to cool large areas within a railway system by using a central cooling plant, which distributes cooled air through a network of ducts. These units are suitable for trains with multiple cabins or compartments where a uniform cooling effect is required throughout the entire train.</p><p>On the other hand, Local Centralized AC units are smaller versions of centralized units and are installed in each individual cabin or compartment. These units function independently and provide localized cooling, allowing passengers to control the temperature as per their preference.</p><p>Both types of AC units are crucial in ensuring the comfort and well-being of passengers during their railway journeys.</p></p>

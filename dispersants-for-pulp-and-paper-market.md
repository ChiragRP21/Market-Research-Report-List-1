<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dispersants for Pulp and Paper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil-based Dispersants</li><li>Acid-based Dispersants</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dispersants for the pulp and paper market can be categorized into three types: oil-based dispersants, acid-based dispersants, and others. Oil-based dispersants are composed of hydrophobic materials that break down the surface tension of oil droplets, facilitating their dispersion in water-based systems. Acid-based dispersants, as the name suggests, utilize acid compounds to disperse solid particles by altering their surface properties. The "others" category includes dispersants with different chemical compositions, such as surfactants and polymers, which aid in the dispersion of both oil and solid particles in the pulp and paper industry.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coated Sand Core Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Method</li><li>Thermal Method</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The coated sand core market includes two major types: cold method and thermal method. In the cold method, coated sand is mixed with a binder and then hardened at room temperature or in a cooling chamber. This method is widely used due to its cost-effectiveness and ease of use. In contrast, the thermal method involves heating the coated sand and binder mixture to a high temperature, which results in the hardening of the core. This method is preferred for complex shapes and high-precision applications, although it is more expensive and time-consuming.</p></p>

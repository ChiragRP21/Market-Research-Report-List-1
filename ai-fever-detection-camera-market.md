<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AI Fever Detection Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cooled</li><li>Uncooled</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The AI fever detection camera market can be categorized into two types: cooled and uncooled cameras. Cooled cameras utilize a cooling mechanism, typically based on cryogenics, to maintain a low operating temperature. This enables them to capture higher-resolution images with enhanced sensitivity, making them suitable for more complex and critical applications. On the other hand, uncooled cameras do not require cooling mechanisms and operate at room temperature. They are generally less expensive, more portable, and suitable for simpler fever detection tasks. Both types have their own advantages and are used depending on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>

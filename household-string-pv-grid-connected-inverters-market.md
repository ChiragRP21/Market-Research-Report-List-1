<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Household String PV Grid-Connected Inverters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Frequency Inverter</li><li>High Frequency Inverter</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Household string PV grid-connected inverters are devices used to convert the direct current (DC) produced by rooftop solar panels into alternating current (AC) that can be used to power households. The market is divided into two main types: low frequency inverters and high frequency inverters. Low frequency inverters are known for their reliability and ability to handle high power loads, but they tend to be bulkier and more expensive. High frequency inverters, on the other hand, are smaller and more affordable but may not be as durable or suitable for heavy loads.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heel Pressure Injury Relieving Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Constant Low Pressure Devices</li><li>Alternating Pressure Devices</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The heel pressure injury relieving devices market includes two types: constant low pressure devices and alternating pressure devices. Constant low pressure devices provide a continuous and uniform level of pressure redistribution to relieve pressure on the heels. They are recommended for patients with a high risk of developing pressure injuries. Alternating pressure devices, on the other hand, alternate the pressure between different cells to provide intermittent relief. They are suitable for patients who require active pressure redistribution and have a medium risk of developing pressure injuries. Both types contribute to preventing heel pressure injuries.</p></p>

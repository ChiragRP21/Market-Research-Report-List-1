<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Volume Mode Neonatal Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilators</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Volume mode neonatal ventilators are medical devices used to provide respiratory support to newborn infants. Invasive ventilators are inserted through an endotracheal tube directly into the baby's airway, delivering positive pressure ventilation. This method is commonly used in cases of severe respiratory distress. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, provide respiratory support without the need for an invasive procedure. These devices deliver positive pressure ventilation via a mask interface or nasal prongs, making them suitable for milder respiratory conditions or to avoid potential complications of invasive ventilation.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neutral-density Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Reflective Type</li><li>Reflective Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neutral-density filters are optical devices used in photography and cinematography to reduce the intensity of light without altering its color. Non-reflective type filters are designed to minimize reflection and glare by incorporating anti-reflective coatings, resulting in better image quality and reduced unwanted light. Reflective type filters, on the other hand, utilize a reflective coating on the surface to absorb and reflect a portion of incoming light, providing an even reduction of light across the entire spectrum. Both types offer various levels of light reduction and cater to different needs in the market.</p></p>

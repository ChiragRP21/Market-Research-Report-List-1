<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Oil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Synthetic Blend Oil</li><li>Full Synthetic Oil</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Synthetic oil is categorized into two types: synthetic blend oil and full synthetic oil. Synthetic blend oil is a mixture of synthetic oil and conventional oil, offering a balance between performance and cost-effectiveness. It provides better protection than conventional oil but is not as advanced as full synthetic oil. On the other hand, full synthetic oil is made entirely from synthetic base oil and offers superior protection and performance. It is designed to withstand extreme temperatures and provides enhanced engine cleanliness. However, it generally comes at a higher price than synthetic blend oil.</p></p>

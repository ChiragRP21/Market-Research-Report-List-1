<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Steering Column Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydraulic Power Steering Column</li><li>Electric Power Steering Column</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive steering column market is divided into two main types: Hydraulic Power Steering (HPS) Column and Electric Power Steering (EPS) Column. HPS Column utilizes hydraulic fluid pressure to assist in steering, providing a smoother and more comfortable driving experience. On the other hand, EPS Column uses an electric motor to generate the necessary steering force, resulting in improved fuel efficiency and easier maneuverability. Both types aim to enhance steering control and overall performance, but differ in their mechanisms and benefits.</p></p>

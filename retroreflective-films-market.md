<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Retroreflective Films Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Glass Bead Type</li><li>Micro-prism Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Retroreflective films are commonly used for road signs, traffic safety apparel, and vehicle marking purposes. There are two main types of retroreflective films: glass bead type and micro-prism type. </p><p>Glass bead retroreflective films use tiny glass beads embedded on their surface. When light hits these beads, it is reflected back towards the light source. These films are cost-effective and suitable for short-distance visibility.</p><p>Micro-prism retroreflective films consist of small prismatic structures that reflect light back in a more concentrated manner. They offer better long-distance visibility and are often used in high-quality markings or signage that require enhanced visibility during nighttime or adverse weather conditions.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EV IGBT Modules Heatsink Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-Cooled Heatsink</li><li>Water-Cooled Heatsink</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The EV (Electric Vehicle) IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor) Modules Heatsink market consists of two main types of heatsinks: air-cooled heatsinks and water-cooled heatsinks. Air-cooled heatsinks rely on the flow of air to dissipate heat from the IGBT module, while water-cooled heatsinks use water as a coolant to absorb and remove heat. Air-cooled heatsinks are more affordable and easier to install, but they have limited cooling capacity. On the other hand, water-cooled heatsinks offer better cooling performance and can handle higher heat loads, but they require more complex installation and maintenance.</p></p>

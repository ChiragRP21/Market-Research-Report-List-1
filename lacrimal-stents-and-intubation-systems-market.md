<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lacrimal Stents and Intubation Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monocanalicular Stents</li><li>Bicanalicular Stents</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Lacrimal stents and intubation systems are medical devices used to treat tear duct blockage and promote tear drainage. Monocanalicular stents are thin tubes inserted into a single tear duct, while bicanalicular stents are inserted into both tear ducts. Monocanalicular stents are used for partial obstructions or when only one tear duct needs treatment, whereas bicanalicular stents are employed for complete obstructions or when both tear ducts require intervention. These systems help restore tear flow, reduce eye irritation, and may require periodic removal or replacement as needed.</p></p>

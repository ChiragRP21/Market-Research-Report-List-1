<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Valve Retractors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sliding Type</li><li>Rotating Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Heart valve retractors are medical devices used during open-heart surgeries to hold back the surrounding tissues and provide surgeons with optimal visibility and access to the heart valves. Two common types of heart valve retractors are the sliding type and rotating type. Sliding type retractors operate by sliding a blade within a fixed frame, allowing for precise placement and adjustment. Rotating type retractors feature a rotating mechanism that enables controlled movement of the blades, facilitating better control during surgery. Both types aim to assist surgeons in performing safe and effective heart valve procedures.</p></p>

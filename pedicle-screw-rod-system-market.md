<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pedicle Screw Rod System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monoaxial Pedicle Screw Rod System</li><li>Polyaxial Pedicle Screw Rod System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Pedicle Screw Rod System market is categorized into two types: Monoaxial Pedicle Screw Rod System and Polyaxial Pedicle Screw Rod System. </p><p>Monoaxial Pedicle Screw Rod System refers to a system where the screw can only be inserted in a fixed direction or angle. This type provides stability but restricts the flexibility of the screw placement.</p><p>On the other hand, Polyaxial Pedicle Screw Rod System allows the screw to be inserted at various angles and directions, providing more flexibility during surgery. It offers easier screw placement and reduces the risk of screw pull-out.</p></p>

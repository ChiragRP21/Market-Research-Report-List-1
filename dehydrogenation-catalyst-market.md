<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dehydrogenation Catalyst Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Catalyst</li><li>Deactivation Catalyst</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Dehydrogenation Catalyst market can be divided into two types: Active Catalyst and Deactivation Catalyst. Active Catalysts are substances that promote the dehydrogenation reaction by providing an active site where reactant molecules can bind and undergo dehydrogenation. They enhance the efficiency of the reaction and increase the yield of the desired product. On the other hand, Deactivation Catalysts are substances that inhibit or slow down the dehydrogenation reaction, reducing the catalyst's effectiveness over time. These catalysts may undergo changes in their structure or become contaminated, leading to a decrease in catalytic activity.</p></p>

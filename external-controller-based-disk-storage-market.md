<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The External Controller-based Disk Storage Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hard Disk</li><li>Floppy Disk</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>External controller-based disk storage refers to a type of storage system that connects to a computer system through an external controller. There are two main types of external controller-based disk storage: hard disk and floppy disk. Hard disk storage uses rigid magnetic disks to store data, offering higher storage capacity and faster access times compared to floppy disks. On the other hand, floppy disk storage uses flexible magnetic disks enclosed in a protective casing, providing lower storage capacity and slower access times. Both storage types were popular in the past but have been largely replaced by more advanced storage technologies.</p></p>

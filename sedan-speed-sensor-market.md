<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sedan Speed Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The sedan speed sensor market consists of two types: active and passive. Active sensors require a power source and actively emit signals to measure the vehicle's speed. These sensors are more accurate and provide real-time readings. On the other hand, passive sensors do not require a power source and rely on existing signals within the vehicle to measure speed. While passive sensors are less accurate, they are more cost-effective. These two types offer different options for car manufacturers when choosing speed sensors for their sedan models.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Sedan Speed Sensor Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sedan</li><li>Hatchback</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The speed sensor market application in sedans and hatchbacks refers to the use of speed sensors in these types of vehicles. Sedans are four-door passenger cars, while hatchbacks have a rear door that includes the back window and extends down to the bumper. Speed sensors in sedans and hatchbacks are crucial components that measure the rotational speed of the wheels and provide information to the vehicle's control systems. This helps in monitoring the speed and ensuring the accuracy of various functions such as speedometer readings, cruise control, and ABS (anti-lock braking system) operation.</p></p>

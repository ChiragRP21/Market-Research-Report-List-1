<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Croscarmallose Sodium Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tablets</li><li>Capsules</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The croscarmallose sodium market comprises two major segments: tablets and capsules. Tablets are solid dosage forms made by compressing pharmaceutical ingredients with other excipients, including croscarmallose sodium, to form a compacted product. Croscarmallose sodium acts as a disintegrant, allowing the tablet to rapidly break down into smaller particles upon ingestion, aiding in drug dissolution and absorption. Similarly, capsules are also oral dosage forms that enclose active ingredients within a gelatin shell, with croscarmallose sodium used as a disintegrant to promote drug release within the body.</p></p>

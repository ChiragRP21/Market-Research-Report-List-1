<p><strong>The Fan-Coil Connection Hoses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fan-Coil Connection Hoses with Braided</li><li>Fan-Coil Connection Hoses without Braided</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Fan-coil connection hoses are flexible hoses used to connect fan coil units to the water supply system. These hoses come in two types: with braided and without braided. Fan-coil connection hoses with braided are reinforced with a braided layer, providing them with added strength and durability. On the other hand, fan-coil connection hoses without braided do not have this reinforcement, making them more suitable for low-pressure applications. Both types are commonly used in HVAC systems to ensure reliable water supply and temperature control in fan coil units.</p></p>

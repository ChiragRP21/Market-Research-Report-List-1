<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Construction Steel Weldmesh Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spacing ≤ 100mm</li><li>Spacing 100-200mm</li><li>Spacing ≥ 200mm</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Construction steel weldmesh is a type of steel mesh used in construction projects for reinforcement and security purposes. There are three types of weldmesh available based on the spacing of the wires. Spacing ≤ 100mm refers to weldmesh with wire openings less than or equal to 100mm, suitable for applications requiring finer mesh and higher strength. Spacing 100-200mm indicates a medium-sized mesh, ideal for general construction purposes. Spacing ≥ 200mm represents a larger wire opening, providing greater visibility and ventilation while still ensuring structural stability.</p></p>

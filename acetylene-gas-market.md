<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acetylene Gas Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Calcium Carbide Production Type</li><li>Hydrocarbon Pyrolysis Production Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Acetylene gas is produced through two main processes: calcium carbide production and hydrocarbon pyrolysis. In the calcium carbide production type, acetylene gas is generated by reacting calcium carbide with water. This process is commonly used in regions with limited access to natural gas. On the other hand, the hydrocarbon pyrolysis production type involves the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons, such as methane or ethane, to produce acetylene gas. This method is generally used in areas with abundant natural gas resources.</p></p>

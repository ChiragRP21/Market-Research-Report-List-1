<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hull Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Polishing Coatings (SPCs)</li><li>Fouling Release Coatings (FRC)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Hull coatings are used to protect ships' hulls from fouling and maintain their performance. Self-Polishing Coatings (SPCs) gradually release biocides, preventing marine organisms from attaching to the hull. This helps to reduce drag and improve fuel efficiency. On the other hand, Fouling Release Coatings (FRC) provide a smooth and slippery surface, discouraging organisms from firmly attaching. These coatings minimize hull fouling and can be easily cleaned without damaging the environment. The market for both SPCs and FRC is driven by the need for efficient hull maintenance, cost savings, and environmental concerns.</p></p>

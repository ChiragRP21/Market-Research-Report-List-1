<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Differential Protection Relay Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Current Differential Relay</li><li>Biased or Percentage Differential Relay</li><li>Voltage Balance Differential Relay</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The differential protection relay market is categorized into three types: current differential relay, biased or percentage differential relay, and voltage balance differential relay. Current differential relay operates based on the comparison of incoming and outgoing currents to detect any fault in the power system. Biased or percentage differential relay includes a biasing system to ensure stable operation and prevent nuisance tripping. Voltage balance differential relay examines the voltage balance across a transformer's windings to identify any internal faults. These different types cater to specific needs and requirements in the protection of power systems.</p></p>

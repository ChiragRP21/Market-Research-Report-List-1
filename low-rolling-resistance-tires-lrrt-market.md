<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low Rolling Resistance Tires (LRRT) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>All-Steel Tire</li><li>Semi-Steel Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Low Rolling Resistance Tires (LRRT) are designed to reduce the energy loss caused by tires rolling on the ground. All-Steel Tires, also known as radial tires, use steel wires for both the tire carcass and the belts. They offer better durability, load carrying capacity, and fuel efficiency. Semi-Steel Tires, also known as bias-ply tires, have steel belts but a fabric carcass. They provide good traction and handling, but are less fuel efficient compared to all-steel tires. Both types are aimed at reducing rolling resistance and improving vehicle efficiency.</p></p>

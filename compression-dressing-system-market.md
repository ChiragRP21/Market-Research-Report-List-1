<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Compression Dressing System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Cooler</li><li>Without Cooler</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Compression dressing systems with a cooler are designed to provide both compression and cooling therapy. They typically consist of a compression wrap or garment that includes a cooling element, such as a gel pack or ice pack, which helps reduce pain and swelling. On the other hand, compression dressing systems without a cooler do not have a built-in cooling element. These systems still provide compression therapy, but do not offer the additional benefit of cooling. Both types of systems are used for various conditions, such as injuries, post-surgical recovery, or chronic edema management.</p></p>

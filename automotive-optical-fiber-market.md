<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Optical Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multimode Fiber</li><li>Single-Mode Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive optical fiber market consists of two types: multimode fiber and single-mode fiber. Multimode fiber has a larger core diameter, allowing multiple light rays to travel simultaneously, which makes it suitable for shorter distance transmissions. On the other hand, single-mode fiber has a smaller core, allowing only a single light ray to propagate, making it ideal for longer distance transmissions. Both types serve different purposes within the automotive industry, with multimode fiber being used for infotainment systems and single-mode fiber for advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous driving applications.</p></p>

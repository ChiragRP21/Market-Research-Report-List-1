<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rust Resisting Pigment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Physical Antirust Pigment</li><li>Chemical Antirust Pigment</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Rust Resisting Pigment market consists of two main types: Physical Antirust Pigment and Chemical Antirust Pigment. Physical Antirust Pigment is a type of pigment that provides a physical barrier to prevent rust formation on the surface it is applied to. It acts as a shield by creating a barrier between the metal surface and the environment, preventing corrosion. On the other hand, Chemical Antirust Pigment works by inhibiting the chemical reactions that lead to rust formation, slowing down the corrosion process. Both types play a crucial role in protecting metal surfaces from rust and extending their lifespan.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Densitometry Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Diagnostic Tests Type</li><li>Screening Tests Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Bone densitometry systems are used to assess bone health and diagnose conditions like osteoporosis. The market is divided into two types: diagnostic tests and screening tests. Diagnostic tests are typically used on patients with symptoms or risk factors for bone diseases, providing detailed information about bone density and strength for accurate diagnosis. Screening tests, on the other hand, are used as a preventive measure on asymptomatic individuals to identify those at risk and initiate early intervention. Both types play a crucial role in managing bone health and preventing fractures.</p></p>
